The logistics department wants to improve our delivery system by smartly allocating delivery resources. As part of this effort, we would like to predict the number of order days in the month for each user, and we want to be able to perform this prediction at every point of the month.

The goal of the project is to create machining learning algorithms that, using the database we have so far, can continuously process and identify the number of days of orders.
