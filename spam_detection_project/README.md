# Supervised Learning - Real Estate Market Project
The goal of the project is to create a spam detection system.

Unwanted messages, also known as spam, cause email users to waste a lot of time. In addition, they can be a danger to information security because, in some cases, they contain malicious links with malware. To prevent these crimes, it is necessary to develop a security system that detects spam.

The dataset consists of text messages from volunteers in a study in Singapore and some spam text messages from a UK reporting site mixed together.<br/>
To complete this project all the data was studied and maching learning models was created to do the predictions. <br/> 
All models was used using pyspark with Spark's MLlib. <br/>
The data used is in the file "SMSSpamCollection.csv" in csv format and, after being received, was processed for later use by ML.
