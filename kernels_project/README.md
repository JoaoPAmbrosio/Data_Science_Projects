# Unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering) - Kernels Project
The goal of this project is to create a solution on how to separate different kernel varieties for future studies. To do this, a dataset with data from 210 mixed kernels was provided and used. 

About the sample, it is known that it has three different varieties of grain, Kama, Rosa and Canadense, with 70 elements each, and knowledge of various parameters, such as area, perimeter, length etc.
For this project, all the data was analyzed and an ML model was created, working with k-means clustering, capable of separating the kernels and obtaining the best results.

The model used pyspark with Spark's MLlib.<br/>
The data is in the file "seeds_dataset.csv" in csv format and, after being received, was processed in a notebook for later use by ML. The dataset is not artificial, but real data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is the online machine learning repository of the University of California at Irvine.
