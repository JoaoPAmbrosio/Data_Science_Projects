# Data_Science_Projects

This repository will be used to present some projects written in Python/Pyspark.

The "kernels_project" project is a data science project that works with Unsupervised Learning (k-means clustering) to classify kernels.

The "real_estate_market" project is a data science project that works with Supervised Learning for pricing in the real estate market in Seattle, USA.

In each project, there are files such as the database (.csv) used, and notebook files for working with algorithms.
