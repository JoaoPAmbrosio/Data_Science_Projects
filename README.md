# Data_Science_Projects

This repository will be used to present some projects written in Python/Pyspark.

The "kernels_project" project is a data science project that works with Unsupervised Learning (k-means clustering) to classify kernels.

The "real_estate_market_project" project is a data science project that works with Supervised Learning for pricing in the real estate market in Seattle, USA.

The "spam_detection_project" project is a data science project that works with Supervised Learning (Natural Language Processing - NLP) for spam detection and classification.

In each project, there are files such as the database (.csv) used, and notebook files for working with algorithms.
