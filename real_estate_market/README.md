# Supervised Learning - Real Estate Market Project
The goal of this project is to provide solution on how to price properties . For this, a dataset with data from a few years has been provided, in which all the properties have already been analyzed and the pricing has been done personally.

An old real estate agency located in Seattle, Washington, has been operating in the city for a long time and, in search of new market trends, wants to offer more services in addition to the traditional ones, such as renting, selling or buying real estate.
One new service that is proving lucrative is real estate pricing, but there aren't enough people to work with. As the process is time-consuming, clients are looking for other companies and money is being lost.
In this project, all the data was analyzed using them together and separately, using graphs and maps and more than 08 tests were carried out with different algorithms to obtain the best results.
All models was used using pyspark with Spark's MLlib.
The data used is in the file "seeds_dataset.csv" in csv format and, after being received, was processed for later use by ML.
